# AlgorithmPixelArtDisplayer
A project started with the intention of practicing Git &amp; drawing pixel art (using a programming language such as Javascript). You may share &amp; edit this as you wish however I'd appreciate credit. 

# Project Title
Javascript-Pixel-Art-DIsplayer

# Tools Used
HTML, JavaScript 

# Description 
.An open-source project on Github with the aim of allowing myself and others to express themselves creatively using pixel-art. My aim for the project is for it to act as a canvas for anyone and personally I will be trying to display some interesting pixel-art using the least number of lines of code that I can.
